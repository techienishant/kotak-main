Mountaineers usually set forth on a dedicated path in an expedition. 
Yet there are some who are passionate and are driven by their force of conviction 
to explore the unexplored and chart their own path.

<p class="grey-text">Kotak has always had the courage to break new ground, explore uncharted
territories and reinvigorate the industry. Courage to set benchmarks In its quest to reach the goal, it is as important to create new milestones on the way. With its industry-defining initiatives, Kotak Mahindra Capital Company (KMCC) harnessed its unrivalled product enhancement expertise to take bold and pioneering initiatives in the capital markets at a time when the company was just finding its feet. Along with the stock exchanges, it set a precedent in the book building IPO process, curating an IPO as per international pricing norms of book building.</p>
<p class="grey-text">KMCC’s efforts in price discovery mechanisms, retail participation through the ‘cut off’ concept and addition of the provision of ‘Red Herring Prospectus’ in the Companies Act have contributed significantly in strengthening India’s capital markets. Working closely with the regulator, KMCC also assisted with the T+6 post issue process, revision of the abridged prospectus in IPOs or in the IPO application forms and disclosures, and the framework for anchor investors in public issues, amongst others. In FY 2018-19, KMCC led the largest IPO, largest REIT IPO, largest QIP and largest Block of the year, raising a total of ` 32,983 crore across 14 transactions.</p>

Providing better technology and customised services in addition to the regular advisory on markets and regulations, it captured market share to become one of India’s largest domestic custodians. Its assets under custody reached upwards of USD 30 billion and clientele included marquee investors and foreign portfolio investors.</p>

The Bank’s maxim that ‘return of capital’ is more important than ‘return on capital’ has manifested itself many times in its history and one such example is our Commercial Vehicle/Construction Equipment (CV/CE) loan book. When the CV/CE financing business was going very strong, the Bank foresaw the danger of over-heating in the market and that the industry was</p>

high of ~ ` 8,000 crore in September 2012. During that period, the Bank reduced its monthly disbursement by 80% and largely catered to its existing good customers. The CV/ CE book came down but there was no shutting down of branches and Kotak chose to take the operating expenditure pain rather than capital pain – a strategy that proved to be beneficial amid the peaking NPAs and defaults in the industry. By September 2015, however, on regaining comfort in the segment, the Bank again started increasing disbursements, bringing its book back to ~ ` 8,000 crore in June 2016.</p>

<h3 class="blue-heading">Courage to make strategic shifts</h3>
<p class="grey-text">The mountaineer often needs to change her/his strategy while climbing difficult peaks. Kotak Securities (Ksec) revolutionised the industry in its formative years when the securities business in India operated on the sub-broker business model where the sub-brokers issued contract notes to clients and were also responsible for 
settlement of payment which was fraught with risk of sub-brokers
defaulting to customers. Keeping investor interest and protection in
mind, Ksec decided to revamp its strategy. It issued contract notes and made payout of funds to the client directly and the sub-broker’s role was limited to only coordinating with the client for dealing purposes. This approach later became a directive, when SEBI in August 2004 issued a circular introducing a model tripartite
agreement whereby the sub-brokers were not allowed to issue contract notes to clients and the brokers had to issue them directly. This was a major step towards investor protection that ensured direct movement of funds and securities between the broker and the investor.</p>
